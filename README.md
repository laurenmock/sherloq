`{sherloq}` is an R package that contains six functions for detection capability calculations:

- Limit of Blank (LoB)
    1. Classical
        - Non-parametric
        - Parametric  

- Limit of Detection (LoD)
    2. Classical
    3. Precision profile
    4. Probit  

- Limit of Quantitation (LoQ)
    5. Functional sensitivity
    6. Total error


These functions are based on the Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP17 guidelines for detection capability.



[vignettes](vignettes) contains a [vignette](vignettes/sherloq_demo.html) with a demonstration of how to use `{sherloq}`.

[R](R) folder contains the R functions.

[man](man) contains documentation files (generated by roxygen2) for each R file. Run `?LoB` to view the help page for the LoB function.

[data](data) contains MTM Calibration DEV study data. The vignette uses this DEV data, as well as CLSI EP17 example data, to demonstrate how to use `{sherloq}`. Set the working directory to the package root `setwd(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())` and run `data(LoBdat)` to access the LoB DEV study data. Run `usethis::use_data(df)` to save a new data frame into this folder.

[tests/testthat](test/testthat) contains unit tests. Run `devtools::test()` to run all tests in this folder.




## Installation

You can install the development version of detection like so:

``` r
devtools::install_git("https://stash.natera.com/projects/BIOS/repos/biostatistics_detection_capability.git")
