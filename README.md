sherloq can be used to calculate limit of blank (LoB), limit of detection (LoD), and limit
of quantitation (LoQ) for detection capability studies. This package is based on CLSI EP17
guidelines.

There are six functions in this package:
- LoB (non-parametric or parametric approach)
- LoD_classical 
- LoD_precision_profile
- LoQ_probit
- LoQ_functional
- LoQ_total_error

## Installation

You can install the development version of detection like so:

``` r
devtools::install_git("https://stash.natera.com/projects/BIOS/repos/biostatistics_detection_capability.git")

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(sherloq)
## basic example code
```
